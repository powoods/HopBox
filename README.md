# HopBox
Scripts used for sorting through features extracted using HopBox

Currently there is a single python script in this repo that, when supplied with the Features.csv file produced by HopBox, will by default calculate the means for each genotype across all traits in the file. The script also has the functionality to calculate the broad sense heritability for all traits as well.
